**<h1>MDF-DTA: A Multi-Dimensional Fusion Approach for Drug-Target Binding Affinity Prediction</h1>**

Drug-target affinity prediction (DTA) is an important task in the early stages of drug discovery. Traditional biological approaches take a long time and use a lot of resources because of the large size of genomic and chemical spaces. Computational approaches using machine learning have emerged to narrow down the drug candidate search space. However, most of these prediction models focus on single feature encoding of drugs and targets, ignoring the importance of the integration of different dimensions of these features. We thus propose a deep learning-based approach called Multi-Dimensional Fusion for Drug Target Affinity Prediction (MDF-DTA) to incorporate different dimensional features. Our model fuses 1D, 2D, and 3D representations, obtained from different pre-trained models, for both drugs and targets. We evaluated MDF-DTA on two standard benchmark datasets: DAVIS and KIBA. Results show that MDF-DTA outperforms many state-of-the-art techniques in the DTA task across both datasets. Through ablation studies and performance evaluation metrics, we evaluate the importance of individual representations and the impact of each representation on MDF-DTA. Experimentally, we observe the critical role played by EGNN drug and the ESM-Fold protein representations in final prediction accuracy.
